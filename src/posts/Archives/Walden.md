## 关于阅读

### 1. 阅读的目的

"伟大诗人的杰作尚未得到世人真正的阅读，因为也只有伟大的诗人能够领略它们。
众人翻阅这些诗作一如他们观察群星，只是从占星的方面而非天文的角度。
在很多人眼里，阅读只是为了自己能求得些微方便而已，正像他们认识数字仅仅为了记账，或是做买卖时不会上当一样，至于阅读之作为一项高贵的智力训练，他们则知之甚少乃或一无所知。
然而，在更高的意义上，只有这样才算是阅读：并非视为奢华以求抚慰，亦非让高贵的智性陷入昏睡，而是那种需要我们踮起脚尖，屏气凝神，需要我们无比警觉，时刻清醒的方式。"

“The words of the great poets have never yet been read by mainkind, for only great poets can read them.
They have only been read as the multitude read the stars, at most astrologically, not astronomically.
Most men have learned to read to serve a paltry convenience, as they have learned to cipher in order to keep accounts and not be cheated in trade: but of reading as a noble intellectual exercise thet know little or nothing;
yet this only is reading, in a high sense, not that which lulls us as a luxxry and suffers the nobler faculties to sleep the while, but what we have to stand on tip-toe to read and devote our most alert and wakeful hours to.” 

### 2. 阅读的选择

"我认为识字之后就应该读最好的文学书籍，再不要像四五年级学生那样，永无止境地重复着字母表和最简单的词，终生坐在前排座位。
大多人只消读一读或听一听，或偶然之际因领受了一本好书的智慧，如《圣经》，便浅尝辄止，然后将官能挥霍于一种所谓的休闲阅读而了却余生。
我们的流通图书馆里就有为数不少的书籍归为“初级读本”，我还以为它指的是我未曾去过的某个镇子。
有人简直就是鸵鸟和鸬鹚，遇到这类东西就会照单全收，似乎酒足饭饱依然无法餍（yan 4）足，因为他们无法容忍浪费。
如果有些人算是加工这些饲料的机器，那么他们就是消耗这些饲料的角色。
他们在阅读关于泽波轮和瑟弗洛尼亚故事的第九千个版本——他们的爱情旷古所无，他们真挚的爱情之路布满荆棘云云，无论怎样，这些内容少不了：他们如何相爱然后便遭遇磨难，接着他们重新起身毅然前行！某些可怜虫是如何攀上了尖顶（我看他们最好连钟楼那里都不要上去）。
小说家毫无必要地把他送到那里之后，便陶醉不已地摇起了铃铛，召集全世界前来聆听：哦，天哪他能下来吗！在我看来，小说家最好还是把这类畅销书中意气非凡的男子汉都变成肉质风标，就好像惯于将英雄捧到星座之中那样，然后让他永远在空中旋转直到锈迹斑斑，再不要让他们下来用闹剧欺负老实人了。"
如果小说家下次再摇铃的时候，即便教堂起火，我也丝毫不为所动。

"I think that having learned our letters we should read the best that in literature, and ont be forever repeating our a-b-abs, andwords of one syllable, in the fourth of fifth classes, sitting on the lowest and foremost form all our lives.
Most men are satisfied if they read or hear read, and perchance have been convicted by the wisdom of one good book, the Bible, and for the rest of their lives vegetate and dissipate their faculties in what is called easy reading.
There is a work in several volumens in our Circulating Library entitled "Little Reading," which I thought referred to a town of that name which I had not been to.
There are those who, like cormorants and ostriches, can digest all sorts of this, even after the fullest dinner of meats and vegetables, for they suffer nothing to be wasted.
If others are the machines to provide this provender, they are the machines to read it.
They read the nine thousandth tale about Zebulon and Sophronia, and how they loved as none had ever loved before, and neither did the course of their true love run smooth-at any rate, how it did run and stumble, and get uo again and go on!
how some poor unfortunate got up on to a steeple, who had better never have gone up as far as the belfry;
and then, having needlessly got him up there, the happy novelist rings the bell for all the world to come together and hear, O dear! how he did get down again! For my part, I think that they had better metamorphose all such aspiring heroes of universal noveldom into man weather-cocks, as they used to put heroes among the constellations, and let them swing round there till they are rusty, and not come down at all to bother honest men with their pranks.
The next time the novelist rings the bell i will not stir though the metting-house burn down."

记忆中没有一次我会为阅读文学经典挑灯熬夜，但我会为抓住我的故事与技术文章那么做。
那些满足了欲望的常常占却着明亮的书桌，那些喂食精神的反倒属于了地铁上摇晃的角落。
最开始看到这段的我就正在地铁上，前不久还盘算着晚上补完哪本小说。

### 3. 阅读的环境

“最好的书无人问津，甚至包括那些被称为优秀读者的人。
我们整个康科德的文化又能算得了什么？这里根本不存在对好书的鉴赏，即使那些没有读写障碍的英国文学作品也遭此下场，这种情况极少例外。
即便科班出身或身受文科教育的人对英文经典也了解甚少，或者说一片空白，这种情况俯拾即是。
至于那些承载着人类智慧的书籍，亦即古代的经典和圣书，只要想了解就可以找到，但是人们却不愿意做出哪怕是一丁点的努力。”

"The best books are not read even by those who are called good readers.
What does our Concord culture amount to? There is in thin town, with a very few exceptions, no taste for the best or for very good books even in Engish literature, whose words all can read and spell.
Even the college-bred and so-called liberally educated man here and elsewhere have really little or no acquaintance with the Engish classics;
and as for the recorded wisdom of mankind, the ancient classics and Bibles, which are accessible to all who will know of them, there are the feeblest efforts anywhere made to become acquainted with them."

我读过的好书用一只手数的过来，
看到这段的时候我不禁感叹——“说的真好！”
想安利给旁边的朋友读一下。

“设若有人刚读过差不多算是最好的英文书籍，他又能找到几个人就此进行探讨？
那么，他如果读了希腊和拉丁文的原典——它们的品味连所谓文盲都一清二楚，他会发现压根就没有人可以跟他交流心得，因此他只能保持沉默。
情况的确如此，我们的大学几乎没有这样的教授，他能在多大程度上攻克希腊文法的难点，就能在相应程度上把握希腊诗人的智慧及作品，同时也会将相应的感悟传递给敏锐警悟的读者。
至于那些神圣的典籍，或曰人类的圣经，在这里有谁哪怕能说出他们的名字？很多人都不知道，除了希伯来之外，其他名族也都拥有自己的经典。
有人，或者说所有人，会非常情愿地去拾取银币而不厌其烦，但是又如何面对那些金子般的词句？他们是最特出的古代智者的创造，随后又得到每一个充满智慧的时代的检验。
然而，我们读的却永远是简易读物，先是初级读本和课本，离开学校后便是“小读本”和写给孩童与入门者的故事书。
我们的阅读，我们的谈话，还有我们的思想都处于非常低下的水平，只抵得上侏儒和俾格米人的程度。”

"One who has just come from reading perhaps one one of the best English book will find how many with whom he can convenrse about it?
Or suppose he come frome reading a Greek or Latin classic in the original, whose praises are familiar even to the so-called illiterate;he will find nobody at all to speak to, but must keep silence about it.
Indeed, there is hardly the professor in our colleges, who, if he has mastered the difficulties of the language, has proportionally mastered the difficulties of thr wit and poetry of a Greek poet, and has any sympathy to impart to the alert and heroic reader;
and as for the sacred Scriptures, or Bibles of mankind, who in this town can tell me even their titles? Most men do not know that any nation but the Hebrews have a scripture.
A man, any man, will go considerably out of his way to pick up a sliver dollar; but here are golden words, which the wisest men of antiquity have uttered, and whose worth the wise of every succeeding age have assured us of;
and yet we learn to read only as far as Easy Reading, the primers and class-books, and when we leave school, the "Little Reading," and story-books, which are for boys and beginners;
and our reading, our conversation and thinking, are all on a very low level, worthy only of pygmies and manikins."

### 4. 阅读的魅力

“我渴望结识比土生土长的康科德人更富智慧的那些人，他们的名字在这里几乎无人知道。
难道我会听说过柏拉图的名字而压根不读他的著作？这恰如柏拉图是一位我未曾谋面的同乡：他是我的近邻，我却从未听过他的言谈或留意过他言辞中的智慧。但实际情况如何呢？
那本蕴含着他不朽思想的《对话篇》就在我近旁的书架上，而我却从未翻开过。
我们真是教养欠缺，粗鄙浅陋之辈！就这方面而言，我可以坦白地说，本乡目不识丁的文盲跟那些尽管识字但一味阅读低幼弱智书籍的文盲之间没什么明显的区别。
我们应该像先贤看齐，但我们首先要去了解他们是何等出色。
我们是侏儒，我们也翱翔——但我们的心智遨游却从未越过日报专栏的那个高度。”

“I aspire to be acquainted with wiser man than this Concord soil has produced, whose names are hardly known here.
Or shall I hear the name of Plato and never read his book? As if Plato were my townsman and I never saw him-my next neihbor and I never heard him speak or attended to the wisdom of his work. But how actually is it?
His Dialogues, which contain what was immortal in him, lie on the next shelf, and yet i never read them.
We are underbred and lowlived and illiterate; and in this respect I confess I do not make any very broad distinction between the illiterateness of my townsman who cannot read at all and the illiterateness of him who has learned to read only what is for children and feeble intellects.
We should be as good as the worthies antiquity, but partly by first knowing how good thet were.
We are a race of tit-men, and soar but little higher in our intellectual flighits than the columns of the daily paper.”

### 5. 阅读的意义

“并非所有的书籍如同其读者那样乏味无趣。
世上或许就有书恰如其分地反映了我们的处境，如果我们能够悉心领教的话，它们会为我们的生命带来比清晨和春天更加健康气息，或许还会让我们周围的一切焕发出新的光彩，有多少人就因为读过一本书后便为生命翻开了新的一页！
书籍在等着我们，有时候它会在为我们解密奇迹的同时展示出另一番奇迹；我们会发现某些在眼下难以言说的现象却早已在别处获得了表达;那些折腾我们，让我们迷惘困惑的问题无一例外地访问过所有智者，这些问题在他们那里一个都没有遗漏，他们都根据自己的才能，用自己的语言，结合自己的人生给予了解答。”

"It is not all books that are as dull as their readers.
There are probably words addressed to our condition exactly, which, if we could really hear and understand, would be more salutary than the morning or the spring to our lives, and possibly put a new aspect on the face of things for us. How many a man has dated a new era in his life from the reading of a book!
The book exists for us, perchance, which will explain our miracles and reveal new ones. The at present unuttersble things we may find somewhere uttered. These same questions that disturb and puzzle and confounds us have in their turn occurred to all the wise men; not one has been omitted; and each has answered them, accordin to his ability, by his words and his life."

突然回想起了很久以前和一个朋友的对话。
C:“为甚么国家发展到现在我还是不可避免的看到贫穷、不公、与社会强加在个人身上的灾难？”
M:“...”
C:“我思来想去觉得这些问题没法解决，只有一个办法——如果有个组织的最终目标是炸掉地球我一定会加入它的！笑~”
M:“你这也太消极了！另外这些不是你需要想的事，国家领导人为这些事情还整天头疼呢吧?”
C:"..."
M:"而且很多问题之前的人肯定也思考过并且有一些解决办法，只不过咱们不知道罢了。"
